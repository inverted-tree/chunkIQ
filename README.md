# Installation
## Requirements
This program is written is pure Rust, so only a Rust toolchain is necessary to build chunkIQ from source. If you do not have Rust installed, check out [the official getting started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). As of now this project is not packaged for any package manager, but I might consider this when it becomes feature complete.

# Modus Operandi
This program works in two modes, [trace](#file-system-tracing) and [parse](#log-file-parsing).

It splits the provided files into chunks of a specified size and calculates a digest for each chunk that serves as a unique identifier for the data in this chunk. It then compares every new digest with a database of existing chunks to find duplicates.

## File System Tracing
This mode splits the file system data into chunks and compares them to find spacially redundant data.

To run chunkIQ in this mode, use
```sh
cargo run trace [OPTIONS] <filenames>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all the options listed under `cargo run trace --help` are implemented yet.

## Log File Parsing
This mode uses the trace files generated by the [trace mode](#file-system-tracing) to find redundancy between the analzed datasets. This mode can be used to find spacial and temporal redundancies.

To run chunkIQ in this mode, use
```sh
cargo run parse [OPTIONS] <trace-filenames>
```

To automate duplicate discovery you may register the trace mode as a Cronjob on your system.

> [!WARNING]
> This mode is not yet implemented.
